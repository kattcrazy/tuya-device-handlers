## How to set up your development environment

The easiest way to get started is to use the [Dev Container][devcontainer]:

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This gives you a fully configured environment with Python, Poetry,
Node.js, and all development tools pre-installed.

### Manual setup

You need Python 3.13+, [Poetry], and [Node.js] (for Prettier).

```console
$ npm install
$ poetry install
$ poetry run prek install
```

[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[node.js]: https://nodejs.org/

## How to test the project

Run the test suite:

```console
$ poetry run pytest --cov tuya_device_handlers tests
```

Run linting and type checking:

```console
$ poetry run ruff check .
$ poetry run ty check src tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests.

Feel free to submit early, though—we can always iterate on this.

To install pre-commit hooks for local development:

```console
$ poetry run prek install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
